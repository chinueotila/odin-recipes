        <p>A japanese dish with a delicious omlete served over rice.</p>

        <p>I prefer this dish served over fried rice made from the night before.</p>
        <p>Alternatively, if I don't have the type of rice I also like to just add it to plain white rice and get creative with the veggies I put on top.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp milk</li>
            <li>Pinch of salt</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat pan over medium heat and grease with a light layer of butter.</li>
            <li>Mix eggs, salt, and milk together in a bowl.</li>
            <li>Pour eggs and milk mixture into heated pan.</li>
            <li>Quickly swirl eggs with chopsticks while the eggs are set yet still runny.</li>
            <li>Now this is the hard part, use your chopsticks to try and fold the omlete. Each side being folded toward the center. It should look like an oval.</li>
            <li>Place omlete on top of your rice, and slice open dow the middle. It should open up into a delicious omlete on top.</li>
        </ol>
