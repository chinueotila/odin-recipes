        <h1>Hamburger Steak</h1>

        <img src="https://itadakimasuanime.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/teriyaki-chicken-burger-steak-k-on-161.png">

        <p>A patty made from ground beef and covered in a rich sauce.</p>

        <p>The recipe will require you to prep veggies so cook and allow to cool in the raw meat</p>

        <p>I would personally reccommend that you eat this over a bed of shredded cabbage and with a side of rice and fresh grape tomatoes</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <h3>For The Patty</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 lb ground beef (I prefer ground Wagyu)</li>
            <li>1/3 cup Panko bread crumbs</li>
            <li>1 sweet onion</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>salt and pepper</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp milk</li>
            <li>Vegetable oil</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>For The Sauce</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 Tbsp Tonkatsu sauce</li>
            <li>3 Tbsp Ketchup</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp Butter</li>
            <li>3 Tbsp Water</li>

        </ul>
        <br>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <h3>Cooking the Patties</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Finely dice the onion.</li>
            <li>Heat 1 Tbsp oil in pan over medium heat.</li>
            <il>Add onion to heated pan and saute until transluscent.</il>
            <li>Transfer cooked onions to a seperate bowl to cool.</li>
            <li>Once the onion has cooled, add the ground beef to the same bowl. Then add salt and pepper to 
                taste.</li>
            <li>Add egg and panko to ground beef and onions.</li>
            <li>With a spatula (or your hands) mix everything together in the bowl until it is combined evenly.</li>
            <li>Seperate the ground beef into smaller patties and shape them into ovals.</li>
            <li>Add 1 Tbsp vegetable oil to pan and place the patties gently.</li>
            <li>Cook the patties until they are brown on the bottom (about 3 minutes) and then flip and cook for about another 3 minutes, or until the bottom is brown again.</li>
            <li>Add 3 Tbsp of beef broth to the pan and then cover with a lid and allow to cook for about another 5-7 minutes. </li>
            <li>Uncover and check that the patties are cooked all the way. Once they are, transfer them onto another plate but DO NOT clean the pan. We will be using it for the sauce.</li>
            
        </ol>
        <h3>Cooking the Sauce</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Using the pan we just used for the patties, add the butter, tokatsu sauce, and ketchup needed for the sauce.</li>
            <li>Add 3 Tbsp of water.</li>
            <li>Mix well together and bring sauce to a medium boil (simmer).</li>
            <li>Once the sauce thickens, remove from heat and pour over your hamburger steak.</li>
        </ol>
